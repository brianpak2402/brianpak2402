### Who am I?

I'm an undergraduate student studying Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology 🐝. In previous months, I've gained a passion for developing APIs and backend systems that empower web applications, especailly those exploring the intersections between music and computing! Check out the repositories below to see some of my recent works. 

Right now, I am building a serverless, RESTful API with AWS lambda functions that makes API calls to Spotify API and stores user/song data in DynamoDB.

* 🌍 I'm based in Atlanta, Georgia

* ✉️ You can contact me at [brianpak2402@gmail.com](mailto:brianpak2402@gmail.com)

* 🧠 I'm currently learning Next.js, NextUI, Vanilla Extract, Express.js, and GraphQL.
