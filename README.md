### Who am I?

I'm a software engineer at Ridgeline ⛰️ and recent compuers science graduate from the Georgia Institute of Technology 🐝 experienced in enterprise FinTech and music technology. Throughout the past few years, I have actively pursued my interests in building cloud-based APIs (RESTful & GraphQL) and user-cented web interfaces. Feel free to look through some of my older works below!

Currently, I am spearheading the development for a full-stack serverless web application for hosting virtual music sessions, leveraging Spotify's Web API to allow guests to upvote, downvote, and add songs to a host's playback queue. I am also working with the Georgia Tech Center for Music Technology (GTCMT) to build the web interface of Mixboard from deprecated Vue to React Typescript.

* 🌍 I'm based in Atlanta, Georgia
