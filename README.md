### Who am I?

I'm an undergraduate student studying Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology 🐝. In previous months, I've gained a passion for developing APIs and backend systems that empower web applications, especailly those exploring the intersections between music and computing! Check out the repositories below to see some of my recent works. 

Right now, I am helping to build lambda functions to make API calls for a virtual jukebox, powered by Spotify and led by you! 

* 🌍 I'm based in Atlanta, Georgia

* ✉️ You can contact me at [brianpak2402@gmail.com](mailto:brianpak2402@gmail.com)

* 🧠 I'm currently learning Next.js, Framer Motion, Express.js, and GraphQL.
